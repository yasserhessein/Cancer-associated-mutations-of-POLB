# Cancer-associated-mutations-of-POLB
This study aims to develop an accurate risk prediction model for cancer associated with a specific mutation, along with data analysis and visualization. A machine learning (HML) classification approach was applied to the POLB SNPs dataset, utilizing the Random Forest algorithm combined with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimize hyperparameters and extract the best ones. The RFPSO model demonstrated superior performance. Its accuracy was compared to other state-of-the-art classifiers, including Naive Bayes, K Nearest Neighbors, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Gradient Boosting Machines, AdaBoost, Passive Aggressive, Extra Trees, and Hist Gradient Boosting. The results confirmed the superior classification ability of the RFPSO model in analyzing the relationship between POLB gene variations and cancer onset, providing a strong foundation for further clinical applications and improving cancer diagnosis and treatment.
